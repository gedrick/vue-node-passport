# vue-node-passport

# Description

This is a small example of using an openID provider to add authentication to your  applications. I had a ton of trouble understanding the Passport workflow so hopefully this helps.

It's using Passport, and it's implemented on the frontend using [Vue.js)[https://github.com/vuejs/vue], but any framework would work - accessing a single api point is all that needs to be done to check user logged-in status and retrieve data.
